## General info

At the beginning, our goal was to create a website that allows drawing numbers and typing them. Unfortunately, we have noticed that such an application will require more work from us than we assumed. So we created a simple game that allows users to draw one number and guess it. 
For now it is MVP realization. Our team plans to develop this project systematically. There are still areas that need to be perfected. The next goal is to implement our original assumption.
