## General info

This is a final project of Python bootcamp from Software Development Academy (SDA). Our group had 40-class-hours to finish that project.
At the beginning, our goal was to create a website that allows drawing numbers and typing them.  Unfortunately, we have noticed that such an application will require more work from us than we assumed. So we created a simple game that allows users to draw one number and guess it. 
For now it is MVP realization. Our team plans to develop this project systematically. There are still areas that need to be perfected. The next goal is to implement our original assumption. This is a Django-basted website project which allow to relax and de-stress after a hard day at work. Actually, website consists of two individuals apps, each serving a specific purpose. Below is an overview of each app and its features: Apps
